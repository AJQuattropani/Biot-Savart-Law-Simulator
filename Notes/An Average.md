It is worth noting that, when combined, we get an overall equation of:

$$
\vec{B}(\beta) = \frac{\mu_0I\hat{k}}{2\pi a} \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{1+\beta\sin(\theta)}{(\beta^2+2\beta\sin(\theta)+1)^{3/2}} d\theta
$$

Note the denominator of our vector-part is division by the circumference of the loop, which can be written as as integral in terms of $`d\theta`$:

$$
2\pi a = a \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2a \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} d\theta
$$

This is the average formula, scaled! So we get:

$$
\vec{B}(\beta) = \frac{\mu_0I\hat{k}}{2a} \frac{\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \frac{1+\beta\sin(\theta)}{(\beta^2+2\beta\sin(\theta)+1)^{3/2}} d\theta}{\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} d\theta} = \frac{\mu_0I\hat{k}}{2a} * f_{\text{avg}}|_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}(\beta)
$$

This may be a path forward for developing useful tools for approximation and evaluation. It may be useful to think of the integral question as an average of contributions from current.
