Consider the magnetic field generated by a current-carrying, circular loop of wire with radius R. Along the central axis of the loop, the magnetic field has the general solution:

$$
\vec{H_{axis}} = \hat{k} \frac{IR^2}{2(R^2+Z^2)}
$$

$$
\vec{H_{center}} = \hat{k} \frac{I}{2R}
$$


It is easy to derive this from The Biot-Savart Law, which finds for a generalized set of current elements:

$$
\vec{dH} = \frac{I}{4\pi}\frac{ \vec{dL} \times \vec{r} }{|\vec{r}|^3}
$$

However, attempting to find the magnetic field at other points beyond this narrow strip is considerably more difficult. Complexity quickly takes over, and reduces the problem to one in which the integral becomes non-elementary. There are various computational techniques for evaluating the complete field in problems of this type.

The question is this:

__What is the magnetic field along points coplanar to the loop? How can the integral be reduced and approximated to optimize performance while minimizing discrepancies between the true solution and the computational method selected?__

This leads to further questions, such as:

__Is there a way to iteratively generate better approximations to the problem in terms of elementary functions, which is simultaneously computationally efficient and converges rapidly?__

__When and how can approximations be made for optimization of this particular issue?__

__How can knowledge about the physical properties of magnetic fields assist in improving our simulation?__

__How can techniques applied for this specific problem be used to improve the performance of further generalizations of the problem? (Complete fields, different-shaped loops, etc.)__

Using C++ to optimize memory and performance, these various techniques can be evaluated on the basis of their speed, memory expense, and accuracy.

__Why is this problem relevant?__
In simple applications, such as those with inductors, we use Ampere's Law to find the flux, average strength, and inductance of a circuit by approximating the field outside the component to rapidly fall off to zero. However, this approximation has to be limited. We know because of the Gauss's Law of Magnetism that all magnetic field lines form closed loops. This implies that the flux in the finite area within an inductor is equal to the flux in the infinite area outside the inductor, though the majority of this flux is present in a smaller area *outside and around* the loop. Furthermore, as currents get larger and magnetic fields increase, the "no field outside" approximation becomes considerably and apparently worse. Magnetic astronomical objects, magnetic particles, and fusion reactors are all examples of applications of E&M which need to account for this discrepancy.
